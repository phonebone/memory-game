# Memory game: programming edition ðŸŽ‰

Do you remember (pun intended) that game where you had to flip tiles and find pairs? Yeah, well, you can play that on your screen now!

This game serves as an assignment for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree course I am currently following. Feel free to play (with) it! Use, copy, modify it, do as you please.

## Usage

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a browser. You don't need to install anything.

If you want to play with the code instead, all of the game logic can be found in the `js/app.js` file and all of the styling can be found in `css/styles.css`.

Have fun!
